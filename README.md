# Life-Expectancy-Analysis

Analysis of factors affecting human morality is the subject of much research nowadays. Using the data provided by Eurostat (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/main/data/database) we can train the model foreseen to predict mortality based on air pollution (what is analysed by many research groups for example in "An Association between Air Pollution and Mortality in Six U.S. Cities", Douglas W. Dockery by C. Arden Pope, Xiping Xu, John D. Spengler, James H. Ware, Martha E. Fay, Benjamin G. Ferris, Jr. and Frank E. Speizer; https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199312093292401). 

That repository consists either the transformation of tabular Eurostat data, creation of custom full Air Pollutions & Mortality Dataset and predictions done by Neural Network Model.
